Customizing the From Email Address in Workflows

Question: How can I customize the from email address in workflows?
Answer: There are two options available to customize the from email address in workflows. The first option is to mask the from email address in the Workflows Settings. This allows you to configure the "Sender Details" with a custom value or type in the desired email address. By doing so, you can ensure that the email address used as the sender's email is different from the actual email address, providing privacy and customization to your email communications.

Google My Business Publishing Troubleshooting

Question: What are the considerations for publishing images to Google My Business?
Answer: When publishing images to Google My Business (GMB), it's important to consider the following:

Image formats: Use JPG or PNG formats for your images.
Size range: Ensure that the image size is between 10 KB and 5 MB.
Minimum resolution: The minimum image resolution should be 250x250 pixels.
Relevance: Post relevant photos that showcase your product or accurately represent your business. Avoid posting irrelevant photos.
Question: What is the requirement for a GMB location to successfully publish a post?
Answer: To successfully publish a post on GMB, your business location must be verified. After completing the listing of your location, verify your business location in Google My Business. You can check the location's status by clicking on "Manage location" or using the Social Planner tool, where you can find the option to verify or unverify the location.

Question: Is it possible to post to a Google My Business listing with more than 10 locations?
Answer: No, it is not possible to post to a Google My Business listing that has more than 10 locations. Google My Business does not allow users to post to such listings. If you have added more than 10 locations, you will receive a message from GMB stating, "This location belongs to a chain. The Local Post API is disabled for this location." This error occurs when GMB restricts posting through its API for brands with 10 or more locations.

Question: How can I resolve the issue of posting to a Google My Business listing with more than 10 locations?
Answer: To resolve this issue, ensure that you have selected fewer than 10 locations for each brand while integrating with Google My Business. This aligns with the guidelines set by GMB, as brands with 10 or more locations are not eligible for posting through the API. By following this recommendation, you can successfully publish posts to your GMB listings without encountering the mentioned error.
